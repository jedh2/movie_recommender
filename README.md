### Background 
* In June 2024, Netflix was one of the largest media companies in the world and had a revenue of 9.56 billion dollars.1
* Netflix believes it could lose 1 billion dollars every year without their recommendation engine.2
* Netflix creates original content from their recommendation engine with 93% of their original content being renewed.3

### Exploratory Data Analysis :paperclip: 
- [x] Features include user ID, movie title, and user rating
- [x] Movie titles had bad data that required formatting while importing
- [x] Removed 4499 missing rating rows
- [x] Reviewed distribution of ratings
- [x] Plotted movie releases per year

### Data Modeling :bar_chart:
* Used Keras neural network
* Created two models
* 2 layers, Adam optimizer
* 3 layers, SGD optimizer
* Used root mean squared error as main metric
* Adam optimizer gave an RMSE of 0.91

### Applications:
This model can be utilized by entertainment companies to recommend movies, TV shows, books, or other media to customers.

### Next steps:
* Utilize the entire data set for the model
* Try other methods for recommendations, such as cosine similarity for movie descriptions
